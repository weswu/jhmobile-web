class=\"section\">\n          <p>百度到底怎么给网站进行排名的？影响网站排名的因素到底有哪些？这些因素的比例是怎么算的？百度又是怎么分配这些因素的？</p>\n          <p>相信对SEO有一定了解的人都知道影响网站排名最重要的几个因素：内容原创度、更新频率、内部链接、外部链接等等，但百度到底怎么给这些因素打分的呢？相信很多站长朋友并不了解这点，下文，我们将用百分比对其进行一个简单的切分。</p>\n          <p>网络营销培训中讲过，如果网站是一块蛋糕，那么这个蛋糕包含的成分有：域名年限、网页布局、访问速度、网站内容、更新频率、内部链接、外部链接、网站流量，如果百度是一把小刀，那么它在切分这块蛋糕时，划分的方法是：域名年限20%、网页布局5%、访问速度5%、内容和更新一起占10%、内链10%、流量10%、外链20%、其他20%。</p>\n          <hr style=\"background: none;\">\n          <div>1、域名年限</div>\n          <p>域名年限对网站非常重要，将两个收录、外链、访问速度等等不相伯仲的网站一起放在百度面前，百度一定会将域名年限更久的网站排在前面。这或许与中国传统的敬老爱幼美德有一种关系，但百度是敬老的，如果你的域名很老，而且没有出现过违规被罚的情况，对你的排名是非常有利的。</p>\n          <div>2、网页布局和访问速度</div>\n          <p>网页布局的好与坏、访问速度的快与慢，对用户体验来说是非常重要的，其实蜘蛛也是普通访客的一员，它初来乍到时，如果享受到了很好的体验，相信它不会吝惜对你的赞誉之情。</p>\n          <div>3、内容更新</div>\n          <p>一个好的网站，需要大量原创内容持续不断的补充，只有这样，蜘蛛才能不辞辛劳的反复来爬，用户也才有回访的理由。保持内容更新，保证更新的质量和数量，以及更新的频率，对网站的排名，以及排名的稳定很有帮助。</p>\n          <div>4、内部链接</div>\n          <p>链接分为三种：导出链接、导入链接、内部链接。内部链接是网站本身的桥梁，对网站非常重要，它决定着用户或搜索引擎能否顺畅的访问您的网站。内链一定要保持通畅，让蜘蛛可以顺利的爬满你的整个网站。</p>\n          <div>5、外部链接</div>\n          <p>内容为王，外链为皇，外链的重要性可见一斑，但外链并非越多越好，质量很重要，不要使用群发链接，也不要购买黑链，使用正规的方法为自己的网站慢慢增加链接。</p>\n          <div>6、网站的流量 </div>\n          <p>流量对网站的重要性不言而喻，没有访客的网站本身也不存在价值，至于怎么将网站的流量做上去，做好网页设计、网站内容、用户体验，然后将网站的排名做上去，相信流量不是问题。</p>\n        </section>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return
